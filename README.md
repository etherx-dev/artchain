# artchain

## What is artchain?

art assets secured on the blockchain

* the world's first asset registry and deed exchange for art assets
* a single, secure marketplace for collectors, art brokers, and artists to exchange art assets with full provenance guaranteed

* secure exchange via smart contracts and escrow accounts all hashed on the blockchain for full satisfaction for all parties from every transaction

* appraisal and conveyancing costs lowered with our distributed provenance ledger
* our distributed reputation system allows great work to gain traction in the marketplace and promotion to a wide public on an intuitive interface
